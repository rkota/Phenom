In fact, Kennedy Consulting Research & Advisory ranked Deloitte #1 globally in Forensics and Dispute Advisory Services in 2013, and Deloitte was named a 2013 Kennedy Vanguard Leader in both Forensic & Investigative Services and Dispute Advisory & Analysis Services based on breadth and depth of capabilities. <BR><BR>DTBA Analytics is a fast-growth practice within Deloitte FAS that centers around several of the hottest areas of business today – analytics, forensic analysis, and litigation support – and the specialized skills that make careers in these areas both fascinating and in high-demand. Our Analytics team makes extensive use of data, statistical and quantitative analysis, rules-based methods, and explanatory and predictive modeling to bring insights to client issues in the forensic and transaction domains. We work with Deloitte specialists in many areas, and we apply our solutions to a wide range of highly interesting and complex corporate events, such as forensic investigations, anti-corruption compliance, restructuring, valuation, anti-money laundering compliance, and construction management, to explain what has occurred in the past and to support informed decision making for the future. Our work increasingly employs specialized competencies, such as advanced analytics, visualization, and geospatial techniques. <BR><BR>DTBA Analytics is composed of two Service Areas, which share similar approaches, but offer different experiences and skillsets: <BR><BR><B>Data Analytics:</B></FONT></DIV><UL type=disc><LI><B><I><FONT size=2 face=Arial>Data Analytics: </FONT></I></B><FONT size=2 face=Arial>This involves strategic analysis of structured (e.g. transactional) and unstructured (e.g. text) electronic data, from initial data scoping and collection through transformation and validation, for purposes of deep data analysis and mining.

These methods are used to identify, deter, and prevent fraud schemes and scenarios, develop models that depict or describe historical events, and build predictive models for future anti-fraud and anti-corruption efforts. Analytical methods are also commonly used to mine and develop insights into large volumes of data to help navigate intricate legal processes and identify areas of opportunity for business process improvement. Additionally, analytics is often used to assist troubled companies in peer analysis, quantifying opportunity cost, and discerning areas of strategic improvement. </FONT></LI><LI><B><I><FONT size=2 face=Arial>Application Development</FONT></I></B><I><FONT size=2 face=Arial>: </FONT></I><FONT size=2 face=Arial>From standalone tools to enterprise web applications, we leverage a modern proprietary services-based development platform and agile methodology to assist clients with processing data, presenting findings, and documenting decisions.
